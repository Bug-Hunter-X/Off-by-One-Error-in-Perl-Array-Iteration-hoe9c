This repository contains a simple Perl program demonstrating a common off-by-one error when iterating over an array. The bug.pl file shows the erroneous code, while bugSolution.pl provides the corrected version.  The error occurs because Perl arrays are zero-indexed, but the loop condition incorrectly uses the array's length.
